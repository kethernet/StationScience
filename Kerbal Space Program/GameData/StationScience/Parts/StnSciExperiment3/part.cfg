	description = Retrograde kuarqs are somewhat unstable, so your D-ZZY Cyclotron will have to be operating at near full capacity to reach the 50 you need. Once you have all 50, they'll form into a stable configuration, and your researchers in your lab can get to work. Note: don't attach directly to your station, unless you intend to return it to the surface.
